## About/Purpose ❔
---
This website is to become my personal showcase / portfolio.  Currently, it contains 3 pages (Contact, Portfolio, About), which will contain more content as time goes on.  Eventually, the page will also contain links to my other pages I create outside the portfolio.  You will find some information about me, a collection of pictures from my Iceland trip and a contact page which currently does not function... for now.

## Takeaways 🥡
--- 
* Learned how to implement bootstrap content

* Learned how to manipulate bootstrap content with various sizing, positioning and coloring parameters; this was difficult at first but after many hours of fiddling and watching tutorials, I now understand how the system was intended to be used; very powerful

* Figured out what "mobile first" means in terms of website building with bootstrap; meaning that the content needs to be told what to do when the page is getting larger rather than getting smaller

* Found a quick and easy way to configure column content and limit rows with "row-cols-lg-2" and also configure gutters
